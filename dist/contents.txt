1 0 You: see if anyone needs help.
2 0 You: Hey, do you know what happened here
3 1 Young Man: I have no idea, when I got here this person was
4 1 Young Man: already dead.
5 0 You: What were you doing before then?
6 1 Young Man: What does that matter to you?
7 0 You: I've been through this before. I want to be careful.
8 1 Young Man: Walking home from work, I was the last one to leave
9 0 You: And I assume nothing was special about today?
10 1 Young Man: Nope. I walked home alone, same as I always do.
END 0 You: Hmmm. Thank you, I guess I should talk to that other person.
START 0 You: Hello, mind if I ask you some questions?
1 1 Mysterious Woman: Fine.
2 0 You: Any idea what happened here?
3 1 Mysterious Woman: As much as you.
4 0 You: *Well, this isn't going to get very far*

START 0 You: You claimed you walked home alone the same as usual, correct?
1 1 Young Man: Y....yes... why?
2 0 You: Does that mean no one was with you at all until you got here?
3 1 Young Man: Well of course! I already told you that multiple times!
4 1 Young Man: ...Sorry, its just... I haven't been in a situation like this
5 1 Young Man: before, you understand right?
6 0 You: I'm not sure I do. You see, I talked with the other person over there.
7 0 You: She seems to claim you arrived here at the same time.
8 1 Young Man: What? Are you claiming I'm lying. No one else was with me
END 1 Young Man: When I arrived!
START 0 You: I have one more question, if I may?
1 1 Mysterious Woman: Make it quick.
2 0 You: Are you sure that man over there arrived at the same time as you?
3 1 Mysterious Woman: No. I never claimed that all.
4 0 You: You most definitely said " Me and that man over there were the only one."
END 1 Mysterious Woman: You misheard.

START 0 You: Let me ask a different question. I noticed both of you here, but
1 0 You: why hasn't any one called the authorities yet?
2 1 Young Man: I swore I had.
3 0 You: You swore? 
4 1 Young Man: As I mentioned the shock, I can't quite remember. I swear its
5 1 Young Man: the first... no wait, I didn't. But the other person, she did. I clearly
6 1 Young Man: remember. It was just the shock and all.
END 0 You: *I guess the only way I'm getting anything is by talking to her*
START 0 You: When you came upon the scene of the crime, what was the first thing you did?
1 0 You: Did you call anyone for help?
2 1 Mysterious Woman: Nothing. No need
3 0 You: I'm sorry?
4 1 Mysterious Woman: No reason to do it. Won't solve anything.
5 0 You: I don't follow.

3 0 You: You don't sound so sure.
END 1 You: *cough* *cough* I'm positive I saw her do it.
START 0 You: Your story seems to again not line up with his.
1 1 Mysterious Woman: I assume he claims I called for help first thing
2 0 You: Yes... yes actually. Thats exactly what he claimed
3 1 Mysterious Woman: Look at him. Does he look like hes in the state
4 1 Mysterious Woman: of someone with a trustworthy memory?

12 1 Young Man: And what are you asking me? Leave this stuff to the detectives.
13 0 You: Well, I was just wondering if you noticed anything strange about the body.
14 1 Young Man: N..no, the arm was covered in blood the moment I got here. *cough*

START 1 Young Man: I arrived at the scene with that woman. But, neither of us did it.
1 0 You: Did you know each other?
2 1 Young Man: Y...yes...
3 0 You: Then why did you claim you didn't?
4 1 Young Man: I wouldn't say we know each other as much as... work together.
5 0 You: What do you mean by that?
6 1 Young Man: Let's just say.... we wouldn't want anyone else to know

1 0 You: So you didn't know about this murder before it happened?
2 1 Mysterious Woman: Well. I wouldn't say that.
3 0 You: So why... are you here?
4 1 Mysterious Woman: Again, I don't know if you want to know. If you knew what was best,
5 1 Mysterious Woman: you would walk away.
6 0 You: Did you know this person. Why won't you say what is going on.
7 1 Mysterious Woman: Listen.... I gave you every chance to leave this and move on.
8 1 Mysterious Woman: This person is as much as my concern as it is yours.
9 0 She handed me a jacked, with a bloodstained sleeve, and pulled out an ID from its pocket.
END 1 Mysterious Woman: This... is the man who framed you for murder.
