Embroiled in Lies

Author: Ben Cagan (bcagan)

Design: Embroiled in Lies follows an unfortunate soul who, only days after clearing their name after being framed for murder, finds
themselves caught at the scene of another crime, only this time, they aren't the one under suspicions. Talk to the two other mysterious
individuals, and attempt to find your way through their lies, and discover what part you play in this mystery.

Text Drawing: Text is drawn in real time. A font (true type font) is loaded into freetype at run time, and this freetype font faced
is then passed to harfbuzz. Each line is then passed to harfbuzz before its drawn, which shapes it, and then in real time the resulting
buffer is then processed, using the textures generated by freetype to render the given line in 3D space.

How To Play:

Press the left arrow to go back to a previous line, and the right arrow to go to the next. Note, text
will cycle from the last to first and vice-versa, but only during "investigation" portions.
Press 1 and 2 to swap to the first and second (left and right) witness respectively.
Press x to claim if the current line in the first and second individual's dialogue is a 
contradiction. If it is, the text will flash green, if not, it will flash red.
You can also move around the world freely with WASD, and move the mouse to control the camera.
Press escape to unlock the mouse cursor if need be.
Note that following a contradiciton, there will be a segment of exposition, to continue read through
all the dialouge of either individual. This is also the case for the prologue and epilogue.
